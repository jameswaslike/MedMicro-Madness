                { question: "When preparing slides for staining, which of the following is most important?", options: ["Using a sterile cover slip", "Using a non-porous slide surface", "Ensuring the slide is air-dried after fixation", "Using formalin as a fixative"], answer: "Ensuring the slide is air-dried after fixation", explanation: "Air-drying slides after fixation helps prevent distortion of microbial samples during staining." },
                { question: "What is the purpose of a biosafety cabinet in microbiological testing?", options: ["To sterilize equipment", "To protect the specimen from contamination", "To protect the laboratory worker from exposure to hazardous microorganisms", "To incubate cultures"], answer: "To protect the laboratory worker from exposure to hazardous microorganisms", explanation: "Biosafety cabinets are used to provide a controlled environment that protects laboratory workers from exposure to harmful pathogens." },
                { question: "What is the typical incubation temperature for fungi?", options: ["20°C", "30°C", "37°C", "50°C"], answer: "30°C", explanation: "Fungi typically grow well at an incubation temperature of 30°C." },
                { question: "Which of the following is the primary purpose of selective media?", options: ["To enhance the growth of all microorganisms", "To inhibit the growth of non-target microorganisms", "To promote bacterial spore formation", "To separate fungi from bacteria"], answer: "To inhibit the growth of non-target microorganisms", explanation: "Selective media is designed to inhibit the growth of unwanted organisms while promoting the growth of target species." },
                { question: "What is the correct procedure when handling a specimen for DNA extraction?", options: ["Expose the specimen to heat for 30 minutes", "Freeze the specimen immediately upon receipt", "Process the specimen under sterile conditions", "Store the specimen at room temperature"], answer: "Process the specimen under sterile conditions", explanation: "DNA extraction should be done under sterile conditions to avoid contamination and ensure the purity of the extracted DNA." },
                { question: "What is a key difference between enriched and differential media?", options: ["Enriched media supports the growth of fastidious organisms, while differential media distinguishes between organisms based on their metabolic properties.", "Enriched media inhibits bacterial growth, while differential media supports it.", "Enriched media is used only for fungi, while differential media is used for bacteria.", "Enriched media contains antibiotics, while differential media does not."], answer: "Enriched media supports the growth of fastidious organisms, while differential media distinguishes between organisms based on their metabolic properties.", explanation: "Enriched media provides nutrients to promote the growth of fastidious organisms, while differential media uses indicators to distinguish between species based on their metabolic reactions." }
